# pokemine

A Spigot Plugin that brings Pokémon into the game.

If you go by code lines and time invested this is definitely my biggest project.

Features:
	- About 30 Pokémon with cool 3D models
	- Battling and catching them in round based battles with type advantages
	- Battling other players as well as NPC trainers
	- Pokémon centers and gyms
	- Riding, flying, surfing, etc. with Pokémon
	- Trading with other players
	- Towers with strong and legendary Pokémon
	- Battling monsters with Pokémon (in Minecraft style battles)

This project stands in no affilation with Nintendo, The Pokémon Company, GameFreak or Cretures, Inc.
This is just a non-profit fan made game. I don't own the rights on any of the used pokémon (but the models and sounds are made by me).
